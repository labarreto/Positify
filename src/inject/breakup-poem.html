<h1>here is a poem about how much I hate you</h1>
<p>Wow, I hate you. 
	<br> You are very dumb, and an asshole. 
	<br> I do not understand why you call me an ass while you are an asshole.
	<br> Stop sending me dick pics. 
	<br> I hope you die. 
	<br> You should hate yourself because you are very ugly. 
	<br> I can't believe I dated such a freak.
