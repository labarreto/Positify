# Positify
Prototype from Unhackathon 2015 Summer
<br>
Spreading happiness through a chrome extension
<br>
<h1> How to test it : </h1>
<body> First make sure you add the chrome extension manually to Google chrome by :
<br> 1. Downloading a zip
<br> 2. Unzipping the file
<br> 3. Go to menu button on the right-->  more tools --> extensions --> load unpacked extension
<br> 4. head to http://thehackathondemo.tumblr.com/post/128440951361/here-is-a-poem-about-how-much-i-hate-you
<br>     to see the extension in action. 
<br>
We are working on new algorithm to determine negative prefixes, like 'un-' or 'de-' and more. 
<br>
Stay tuned for more updates!
<br>
<br>

<h3>The break up : </h3>
<br><b>Here is a poem about how much I hate you</b>
<p>
<br>Wow, I hate you. 
<br>You are very dumb, and an asshole. 
<br>I do not understand why you call me an ass while you are an asshole. 
<br>Stop sending me dick pics. 
<br>I hope you die. 
<br>You should hate yourself because you are very ugly. 
<br>I can't believe I dated such a freak.
<br>
