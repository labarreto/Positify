The original letter is as follows: 
<br><b>here is a poem about how much I hate you</b>

<br>Wow, I hate you. 
<br>You are very dumb, and an asshole. 
<br>I do not understand why you call me an ass while you are an asshole. 
<br>Stop sending me dick pics. 
<br>I hope you die. 
<br>You should hate yourself because you are very ugly. 
<br>I can't believe I dated such a freak.
<br>
