<h1> testing the chrome extension </h1>
<body> first make sure you add the chrome extension manually to google chrome by:
<br> 1. downloading a zip
<br> 2. unzip file
<br> 3. go to menu button on the right-->  more tools --> extensions --> load unpacked extension
<br> 4. head to http://vassardevils.tumblr.com/post/128438397106/here-is-a-poem-about-how-much-i-hate-you to see the extension in action. 
<p>
The original letter is as follows: 
<b>here is a poem about how much I hate you</b>

<br>Wow, I hate you. 
<br>You are very dumb, and an asshole. 
<br>I do not understand why you call me an ass while you are an asshole. 
<br>Stop sending me dick pics. 
<br>I hope you die. 
<br>You should hate yourself because you are very ugly. 
<br>I can't believe I dated such a freak.
</p>
